### Hi there/Olá! 👋

🌱 I've started developing during @reprograma 's bootcamp (backend on7 with MINAs | aug - dec/20).   
🔭 I'm currently studying: JavaScript(node.js) and Java.  
🔎 I'm also interested in and reading about agile methods (scrum, kanban), clean code, security and testing.  
💗 I consider myself as a lifelong learner.  
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects as back-end developer.
